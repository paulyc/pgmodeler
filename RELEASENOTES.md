v0.9.3-alpha
------

<em>Release date: May 20, 2020</em><br/>
<em>Changes since: <strong>v0.9.3-alpha</strong></em><br/>

<strong>Summary:</strong> after almost two months and keeping the spirit of polishing pgModeler's features during 0.9.3 development we're here to announce important fixes and some interesting new features in 0.9.3-alpha1. <br/>

The first one is the capability of identifying and rendering relationships generated from foreign key constraints with the correct visual semantics. In previous versions, pgModeler rendered FK relationships in a default form which, in majority of times, would not express the real semantics of the linking between tables. Now, pgModeler is able to detect if a FK relationship is of the type one-to-one or one-to-many just by analyzing the involved foreign keys, unique keys and not null constraints. Bear in mind that this is still an experimental feature and eventual false-positive detections may occur. <br/>

Attending to some requests, pgModeler now allows, even inderectly, the modification of objects generated by one-to-one and one-to-many relationships like columns and foreign keys. In order to achieve that an action to convert one-to-one or one-to-many relationships to FK relationships was created. Basically, this conversion detaches the generated objects causing them to be not protected anymore which allows the user to change any of their attributes. The drawback of this feature is that the user loses the automatic column and constraint propagation offered by the relationships. <br/>

Another great new feature is the objects filtering prior to the database reverse engineering. If you constantly work on big databases by generating models from a subset of objects related to those databases this feature is for you! Prior to 0.9.3-alpha1, one needed to load the entire database tree on reverse engineering dialog, select only the desired objects and then perform the importing. This was a really time-consuming operation and even would deplete all CPU and memory resources causing crashes in some cases. Now, the user is able to provide object filters and pgModeler will bring only the ones matching that filters taking a considerable lesser time to construct the database tree/list of the preselected objects as well to import that set of objects. It worth to mention that the CLI also received this feature upgrade with the option --filter and --discard-non-matches. <br/>

pgModeler also received support to some new PostgreSQL 12 features, now the tool is capable of handling generated columns while designing models, importing databases and performing diffs. In the bug fixes side, some crashes were eliminated in different portions of the application. Also, relationships are now using correctly the provided global name patterns. Some fixes on the system catalog queries used by pgModeler when running import and diff brought some performance gain on these operations. <br/>

Finally, the key change log entries in this version are detailed below. For the complete list of changes/fixes, please, read the CHANGELOG.md. <br/>

* [New] Added support to creating initial configuration files from CLI.
* [New] The CLI is now capable of using the objects filtering in reverse engineering.
* [New] Added a warning message when trying to import a big database.
* [New] Added support to object filtering in reverse engineering dialog.
* [New] Adding support to AppImage building for Linux.
* [New] Added support to importing PostgreSQL 12 generated columns.
* [New] Adding support to PostgreSQL 12 generated columns.
* [New] The ModelNavigationWidget now will display a save icon if the current model is pending a save operation.
* [New] pgModeler now guesses if a FK relationship consists in a one-to-one based upon the foreign keys and unique keys settings.
* [New] Improved the rendering of FK relationships. Now it recognizes the minimum cardinality by using the right crow's foot descriptor o|< or ||< in the destination entity.

* [New] Added the paramenter application_name to Connection in order to indentify connections created by pgModeler when querying pg_stat_activity.
* [New] Added support to save/restore Z value attribute in MetadataHandlingForm.
* [New] Created an improved and reusable file selector widget.
* [Change] Avoiding retrieve all types (system and user defined) at once before the reverse engineering in DatabaseImportHelper (Experimental).
* [Change] Minor updates on windeploy.sh and macdeploy.sh
* [Change] Minor improvement on DatabaseImportHelper in order to speed up the objects creation.
* [Change] Improved the execution time for the catalog query of data types.

* [Change] Avoiding the diff process to generate default value changes for generated columns.
* [Change] Minor improvement in LayersWidget in order to allow manual resizing using the mouse.
* [Fix] Fixed a bug when retrieving the refs to some objects in DatabaseModel.
* [Fix] Minor fix in CLI menu and error messages.

* [Fix] Fixed the dependency checking for user defined types in DatabaseModel.
* [Fix] Fixed a bug when loading extension that has no schema specified.
* [Fix] Minor fix in DatabaseImportHelper::createFunction in order to solve eventual duplicated parameter names when importing some functions.
* [Fix] Fixed a bug that was causing global name patterns for relationships to never be used even if they were properly configured.
* [Fix] Minor fix in ModelObjectsWidget and ModelWidget to provide the correct information about objects' selection in SceneInfoWidget.
